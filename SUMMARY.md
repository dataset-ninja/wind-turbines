**Object Detection Dataset - Wind Turbines** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 3020 images with 18289 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *turbine* and *cable tower*.

Images in the Wind Turbines (by Kyle Graupe) dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 18 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (2643 images), *valid* (247 images), and *test* (130 images). The dataset was released in 2023.
