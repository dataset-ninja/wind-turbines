The author of the **Object Detection Dataset - Wind Turbines**  have curated a collection of images featuring wind turbines amidst dynamic and varying backgrounds. The dataset was specifically designed to cater to drone photographers. Considering that several commercial drones, including those from DJI, come equipped with Software Development Kits (SDKs) that support programming in languages like Python, these high-quality camera-equipped drones can be effectively paired with their respective SDKs to undertake remarkable computer vision projects.
